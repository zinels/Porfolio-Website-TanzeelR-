# System Design Diagram Images Guide

## Where to Add System Design Images

Add your system design diagram images to the `public/images/` directory with these exact filenames:

### Required Images:

1. **`researchlink-diagram.jpg`**
   - For: ResearchLink case study system design
   - Recommended size: 1200x800px (16:9 aspect ratio) or similar
   - This will appear in the "System Design Snapshot" section

2. **`scholarscan-diagram.jpg`**
   - For: ScholarScan case study system design
   - Recommended size: 1200x800px (16:9 aspect ratio) or similar
   - This will appear in the "System Design Snapshot" section

## Driving Behavior App

The Driving Behavior App uses a custom SVG diagram showing:
- **Frontend**: Unity
- **GPS & Processing**: Speed Calculation, Muting Logic
- **Data Storage**: CSV Files
- **External API**: Overpass API (for speed limits)

No image needed - the SVG is automatically generated.

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPEG or PNG
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape) recommended
- **Size**: At least 1200px width recommended
- **Content**: Should clearly show the system architecture/design
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web

## Current Status

- ✅ ResearchLink and ScholarScan: Will show images when you add them
- ✅ Driving Behavior App: Uses custom SVG (no image needed)
