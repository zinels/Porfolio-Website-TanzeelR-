# Professional Photo Recommendation

## Current Setup

Your About section currently uses an **AnimatedCharacter** component, which is unique and memorable. However, for a recruiter-first portfolio, a professional photo can be beneficial.

## Why Add a Photo?

✅ **Builds Trust**: Recruiters can put a face to the name  
✅ **Memorable**: Makes your portfolio stand out  
✅ **Professional**: Shows you take your career seriously  
✅ **Personal Connection**: Creates a human connection in a digital space

## How to Add Your Photo

1. **Add your photo** to `public/images/profile.jpg`
   - Recommended size: 800x800px (square)
   - Professional headshot or business casual
   - Good lighting, clean background
   - Smile! (but keep it professional)

2. **Uncomment the Image code** in `src/app/page.tsx` (line ~375)
   - Remove or comment out the `<AnimatedCharacter />` line
   - Uncomment the `<Image>` component

3. **Or keep both!** You could:
   - Use photo on desktop, animated character on mobile
   - Or switch between them periodically

## Photo Tips

- **Professional headshot** (shoulders up)
- **Good lighting** (natural light works best)
- **Clean background** (solid color or blurred)
- **Business casual** or professional attire
- **Genuine smile** (approachable but professional)
- **High quality** (at least 800x800px)

## Current Status

The code is ready—just add your photo file and uncomment the Image component!
