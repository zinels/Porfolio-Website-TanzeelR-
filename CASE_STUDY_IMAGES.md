# Case Study Images Guide

## Where to Add Images

Add your case study images to the `public/images/` directory with these exact filenames:

### Required Images:

1. **`driving-app.jpg`**
   - For: Driving Behavior Research App case study
   - Recommended size: 1200x800px (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - This will appear as the hero image at the top of the case study page

2. **`researchlink.jpg`**
   - For: ResearchLink case study
   - Recommended size: 1200x800px (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - This will appear as the hero image at the top of the case study page

3. **`scholarscan.jpg`**
   - For: ScholarScan case study
   - Recommended size: 1200x800px (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - This will appear as the hero image at the top of the case study page

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPEG or PNG
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape) for best results
- **Size**: At least 1200px width recommended
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web (use tools like ImageOptim, Squoosh, or TinyPNG)
- **Quality**: High quality but optimized for fast loading

## How It Works

The images are automatically loaded from:
- `public/images/driving-app.jpg` → Shows on `/case-studies/driving-behavior-app`
- `public/images/researchlink.jpg` → Shows on `/case-studies/researchlink`
- `public/images/scholarscan.jpg` → Shows on `/case-studies/scholarscan`

## Current Status

The case study pages are now set up to use real images instead of placeholders. Simply add your images to `public/images/` with the filenames above, and they will automatically appear!
